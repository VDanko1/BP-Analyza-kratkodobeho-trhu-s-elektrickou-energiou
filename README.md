My first experience with ML models and Data Analysis in Python using his libraries.

TODO: Automatically fetch the newest data when starting the app, 
add multithreading to prevent the GUI from freezing while the model is training, 
and explore different approaches for price prediction, 
such as using more sophisticated models, as the data is too complex.


TL:DR - just run main.
